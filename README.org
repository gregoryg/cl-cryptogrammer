#+title: cl-cryptogrammer - Cryptogram Generator in Common Lisp

* Overview


Originally created using an Org Mode task list [[id:0992c765-01f8-40a5-a536-0fd84306055d][Cryptogram generator in Common Lisp]]

Test cryptograms with [[https://www.boxentriq.com/code-breaking/cryptogram][Cryptogram Solver (online tool) | Boxentriq â‰« www.boxentriq.com]]

* Usage
Run from sources:

    #+begin_src bash
    make run
    # aka sbcl --load run.lisp

    LISP=ccl make run
    #+end_src

or build and run the binary:
    #+begin_src bash
      $ make build
      $ ./cl-cryptogrammer
    #+end_src

* Roswell integration

Roswell is an implementation manager and [[https://github.com/roswell/roswell/wiki/Roswell-as-a-Scripting-Environment][script launcher]]

A POC script is in the =roswell/= directory.

Your users can install the script with =gregoryg/cl-cryptogrammer=.

* Dev

Tests are defined with [[https://common-lisp.net/project/fiveam/docs/][Fiveam]]

Run them from the terminal with =make test=.

    #+begin_src bash
      make test
